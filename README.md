This is a neural network that uses gpt2 to recognize basic images and saves the best model locally. 

The path for the images and text files must look like flickr8k -> train.txt/val.txt/images->images, where -> denotes a new folder. 

Get the Flickr files from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Om_2kDFNG00-elLHJ_yXOk_q56Nx8lzF
